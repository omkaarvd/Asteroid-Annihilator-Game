# Asteroid Annihilator Game

A classic arcade-style space shooter game where players control a spaceship to destroy asteroids while avoiding collisions. This project features two different implementations of the same game concept, each generated by a different AI model.

## Game Versions

This project includes two versions of the game:

1. **Claude 3.7 Sonnet Version**: A retro-styled implementation with green terminal aesthetics and minimalist design.
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro Version**: A more graphically styled implementation with cyan ship colors and a more modern UI look.

Both versions offer the same core gameplay but with different visual styles and slight variations in mechanics.

## Features

- **Spaceship Controls**: Navigate through space using directional controls
- **Weapon System**: Shoot lasers with cooldown mechanics
- **Asteroid Physics**: Asteroids split into fragments when destroyed
- **Scoring System**: Earn points by destroying asteroids and fragments
- **Lives System**: Limited lives with visual indicators
- **Hyperspace Jump**: Emergency teleportation with cooldown and malfunction risk
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Increasing challenge as you play longer
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## Game Controls

| Action          | Keys           |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Move Forward    | Up Arrow, W    |
| Turn Left       | Left Arrow, A  |
| Turn Right      | Right Arrow, D |
| Fire Laser      | Spacebar, Z    |
| Hyperspace Jump | H              |

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Choose your preferred AI-generated version (Claude or Gemini)
3. Use the controls to navigate your ship and destroy asteroids
4. Avoid collisions with asteroids and their fragments
5. Use hyperspace jump as a last resort (has cooldown and may malfunction)
6. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Technical Implementation

The game is built using:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and physics
- No external libraries or dependencies

Both versions implement:

- Collision detection systems
- Particle effects
- Physics-based movement
- Game state management
- UI/UX elements

## Installation

No installation required! Simply download the project files and open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Browser Compatibility

The game works best in modern browsers that support HTML5 and CSS3:

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Edge
- Safari

## Development Notes

This project demonstrates two AI approaches to implementing the same game concept. Key differences include:

- Visual styling
- UI layout
- Physics implementations
- Code structure and organization

## Credits

This project was created as a demonstration of AI-generated game development:

- Claude 3.7 Sonnet version - Created by Anthropic's Claude AI
- Gemini 2.5 Pro version - Created by Google's Gemini AI

Inspired by the classic arcade game Asteroids.
